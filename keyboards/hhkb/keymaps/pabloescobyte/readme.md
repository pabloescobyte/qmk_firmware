# Pabloescobyte's personal HHKB layout

This is my personal HHKB layout after installing a HASU into an HHKB Pro 2.

Much of this layout is meant to mirror my daily driver--the minivan which is a 40% keyboard.

I've set the CAPS key to FN1 and access layer 1, SPACEBAR functions as usual when tapped but when held down acts as FN2.

I've put the numbers under the home row and the corresponding shifted symbols above on the QWERTY row. Additionally the F-keys are on the ZXCV row.

This allows me to keep my hands on home row at all times and simply hold down CAPS or SPACEBAR when I need number or symbols as well as to perform any hotkeys without having to over extend my reach for anything.

The RSHIFT key is used as another momentary toggle. This time holding it down and using PL;' acts as a mouse cursor. RSHIFT+K is left click, RSHIFT+, is right-click. This helps me do everything on the keyboard without having to use the mouse unless absolutely necessary.

I should add that I use a trackball so my right arm and hand only have a short distance to travel in order to make precise selections or movements.
